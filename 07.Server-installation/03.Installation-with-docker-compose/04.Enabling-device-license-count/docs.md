!!!!! Device License Count is only available in Mender Enterprise.
!!!!! Ignore this section if you are running Mender Open Source.

To enable the [device license count](../../07.Device-license-count/docs.md) in your composition,
you must schedule a cronjob to run the device-count command daily.

Assuming you have [cron](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/crontab.5.html) available
you can create a crontab entry in the following way:

```shell
echo "7 3 * * * cd YOUR-SERVER-ROOT && docker-compose run --entrypoint /usr/bin/deviceauth-enterprise mender-device-auth license-count" | crontab -
```

where `YOUR-SERVER-ROOT` stands for the server root path where all the docker compose files are present.
